# Imagine you work at the admission office of some university, and you need to select successful applications for the next academic year.
# 
# All candidates took entry exams in Maths, Physics, and English. 
# Results are stored in the lists scores_maths, scores_physics and scores_english respectively.
# 
# To enter the university, a student must get at least 270 points in total. How many students will be admitted?
